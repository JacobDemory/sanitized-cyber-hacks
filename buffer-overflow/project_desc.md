In this assignment, you will explore buffer overflows. Make sure
that you test everything using the official course docker image.

## Purpose

In this project, you will learn to:

 * Evaluate C source code for security vulnerabilities; this is an
   important part of writing more secure code yourself, since it will
   train you to notice when you are engaging in unsafe coding
   practices.
 * Use the debugger to examine memory and track program flow; this is
   an incredibly useful skill beyond secure coding, since a large
   fraction of programming time is some form of debugging.
 * Work with simple networking functions; many of the programs you
   will write throughout your career will involve communications over
   the network, so some exposure to how this works (and where it might
   potentially introduce errors) is valuable.
 * Compose an attack message; while most of you will not be creating
   attacks professionally, this requires the kind of precision that
   you will often need.

Please note that there is a timed in-person follow-on to this project,
in which you will not be permitted to consult with any sources. We
recommend that you take thorough notes as you work through this
project, and study these notes before your follow-on.

## Security Mechanisms

 * The C compiler uses a security mechanism called "Stack Guard",
   which detects and prevents buffer overflows. We have provided
   you with a Makefile that compiles your code with this disabled
   by default.

 * Additionally, the operating system performs address space
   randomization (ASLR), which does not prevent buffer overflows, but
   makes it much harder for them to result in a successful
   exploit. You will need to work around this for this project!  As a
   hint, ASLR will move things around in blocks, so stack and heap
   offsets will differ between runs, but the fundamental structure
   will not be changed, so if you know the distance (in bytes) between
   two values on the stack, that distance will remain constant from
   one run to another.

   If you are running on Windows, you might not have ASLR enabled, especially
   when running in gdb. If you're seeing consistent addresses, try running
   the following in gdb before running target:

   ```
   set disable-randomization off
   ```

   If you still see consistent addresses, you might need to adjust the Windows
   security settings. The path to the setting is
    * Settings
    * Privacy & security
    * Windows Security
    * App & browser control
    * Exploit protections
    * Force randomization for images (Mandatory ASLR)


## Exploiting a Vulnerable Program

We have provided you with a vulnerable program in `target.c` -- you are
not to modify this. The Makefile will compile this as needed to allow
us to exploit it, including making it setuid-root. To compile, you
should run the `build.sh` script, which will do the compilation in a
container running the `baseline` image.

This program has a function `bof()`, which includes a buffer-overflow
vulnerability. The program reads from the network, does some useless
work with the provided data, and echoes back part of what you sent
it. You will be attacking it over the network.

We have provided you with an initial skeleton for `exploit.c`.  The
term shellcode literally refers to code that starts a command shell,
like bash. However, nowadays shellcode is considered to be any byte
code that can be inserted into an exploit to accomplish a particular
objective. The shellcode provided in `exploit.c` is designed to
execute the command `cat /var/secret/token`. When run normally, this
command results in permission denied since `/var/secret` is accessible
only to root. You will attempt to execute this command by exploiting
the buffer overflow vulnerability in `target.c` We have provided
shellcode for both x86_64 (AMD64) and aarch64 (ARM64), and everything
is configured so that whichever platform you are using, the attack
will be identical. As a bonus hint, for students on the aarch64
architecture there is a `shim()` function that you will find useful.

As a tip, you *will* need to send more than one message to the `target`
program in order for your attack to succeed. Take a careful look at
the function `bof()` in `target.c`, and look for the potentially
exploitable bugs.

### What to do:

Write a program named `exploit.c` that creates and sends a buffer
overflow to `target.c`. The message you send should include:

 - shellcode
 - target address in the stack to which control should go
   when bof() returns

`exploit` takes no command line arguments. If your exploit is
implemented correctly, then when `bof()` returns it will execute your
shellcode, printing the contents of `/var/secret/token`.

Running the code in a container is a bit more complex than running it
locally. To help with this, we have provided the following scripts:

 * `run_target.sh` starts a container with `target` running
 * `run_exploit.sh` runs `exploit` in the same container
 * `run_baseline.sh` starts an essentially idle container

You can also start an interactive container, so that you can run the
programs multiple times without restarts, as well as using `gdb`. (You
can use `run_baseline.sh` to accomplish this, too.) To do this, run:

    docker run --name stack -ti --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt" baseline

Once you have a container running, you can start interactive shells in
it (from other host terminals) with:

    docker exec -ti stack bash

This runs the program `bash` (that is, the shell) on the container
named `stack`, and runs it interactively.

Because the container captures the output from your programs, if you've used
the `run_target.sh` script you can view stdout and stderr with:

    docker logs stack

You will also need to clean up the container when you are done:

    docker rm stack

### How to submit your assignment:

The only file you should need to modify is `exploit.c`. Add, commit, and
push your solution, so that it is uploaded to the server:

    git add exploit.c
    git commit
    git push origin main

### Tips

#### Make sure you can run `target` and `exploit` as provided

You will need to be able to run both in a single container, so that
they can communicate. You can use `run_target.sh` and `run_exploit.sh`
for this.  Don't forget to run `docker kill stack` and `docker rm
stack` when you're finished with the container.

#### Make sure you can run `target` in `gdb`

For this, you will want to use `run_baseline.sh` instead of
`run_target.sh`.  Otherwise, you will end up with two copies of `target`
running, which will likely behave oddly.

#### Examine the behavior of `target` in normal running conditions

In `gdb`, take a look at the memory layout. What information can you
gather, and what can you infer from it?

#### Identify the vulnerability or vulnerabilities in `target.c`

The networking code is not the vulnerable part --- that would just be
cruel on our part.

#### Use the provided attack buffer in `exploit.c`

This buffer is large enough for your attack, and comes pre-filled with
NULLs. Just overwrite the parts that need to be different.
